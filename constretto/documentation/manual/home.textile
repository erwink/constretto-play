h1. Constretto Play Module

p. This module is made to integrate the Constretto configuration[http://constretto.org] framework.

p. If you don't know Constretto it is made by som clever guys in Norway to make it easy to inject environment-aware configuration
in your Java objects.

p. The configuration mechanism in Play does offer a similar feature in that you can differ between different runtime configurations.
However, it does not let you inject configuration by using annotations. This module will let you use the normal --% or 'play id'
 mechanism to choose runtime configuration for Constretto.

p. This module is developed for and tested with Play 1.2.4. I will look in to porting in to Play 2 when the API has been frozen.

h2. Sample application

p. Included in the git repository at GitHub there is a sample application for you to explore.

h2. Getting started

* Add configuration properties to the application.conf
* Annotate static fields in your controller with the standard Constretto annotation @Configuration
* For more information consult the "project Wiki":https://github.com/zapodot/constretto-play/wiki at GitHub
