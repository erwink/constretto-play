h1. Constretto Play Module

p(note). This module is made to integrate the Constretto configuration[http://constretto.org] framework.

p(note). If you don't know Constretto it is made by som clever guys in Norway to make it easy to inject environment-aware configuration
in your Java objects.

p(note). The configuration mechanism in Play does offer a similar feature in that you can differ between different runtime configurations.
However, it does not let you inject configuration by using annotations. This module will let you use the normal --% or 'play id'
 mechanism to choose runtime configuration for Constretto.
